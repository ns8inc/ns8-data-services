[ns8-data-services](https://www.ns8.com/data-services/) is a realtime API to get a user's fraud score, geolocation, device, demographic, search and technology data based on an IP address, user agent and referrer.  

A fraud score is a number from 0-1000 which indicates the likelyhood that the user is a bot.  The lower the score, the more likely the user is a bot.  A score less than 100 means it is very likely the user is a bot.

We use various methods to determine the fraud score, see our [methodology](https://www.ns8.com/data-services/how/).

In addition, the API returns all the detectable information on the user, like the device, geolocation, etc.  This data is aggregated and available for reporting for account holders.

The API uses a REST interface, so it can be used from any platform.

## Free version
There is a free version available that is rate-limited, so it should not be used for realtime access.  No access token is required for the free version.

# Usage

## Server side scoring in Node.js
```javascript

var gator = require('ns8-data-services');

//  Example - within an express route
app.get('/test', function (req, res) {

    var options = {
        accessToken: '',                    
        ip: req.ip,
        ua: req.headers['user-agent'],
        referrer: req.headers['referer'],
        url: req.hostname
    };

    gator.score(options, function(err, result) {

        if (!err && result && result.score < 100)   //  a score less the 100 is very likely a bot
            res.render('botContent');
        else
            res.render('humanContent');
    });
});
```

        * `code` an HTTP status code from the REST call.
        * `message` the associated error message.
    * `result` The user score object.

## Endpoints
We are creating global endpoints for this API.  The API is extremely fast, however we cannot control latency on the internet.  To address this, we support colocation or replication to your cloud provider's site.  Please [contact us](https://www.ns8.com/data-services/) to set this up.

## Sample use cases
- `Ads`	Do not display ads to invalid users. Keep your reputation as a publisher intact.
- `Content Optimization`	Tailor your content based on a user's geo, demo or device type.
- `Offers`	Base offers on search terms, or user's demographic.
- `Publisher Networks`	See which publishers have the best and worst traffic.
- `Save bandwidth`	Why stream videos to bots?
